The repo contains all the practice problems of Machine Learning Course on coursera.com taught by Andrew Ng. The course is taught in Octave/Matlab and the original practice problems are also written in Octave. The repository mostly provides line-by-line translation but preserves the overall logic used in the funtions. The names of the files have been kept the same for clarity.

The purpose of translating these codes is to create a code bank of various machine learning algorithms in python which is, debatably, the most popular language for data science.
